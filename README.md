## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Perform *Supply Chain Data Analysis* to identify inefficiencies.  
- Automate *data workflows* to reduce manual work and errors.  
- Generate actionable insights to enhance *inventory management* and *distribution planning*.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- *Quadratic* â€“ AI-powered spreadsheet for advanced analytics.  
- *N8N* â€“ Automation platform for building workflows.  
- *Excel / CSV Data* â€“ For raw data storage and import.  
- *Python (optional)* â€“ For additional data cleaning & analysis.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Achievements
- Improved analysis speed by *35%* using *AI Agentic Workflow Automation Tools*.  
- Reduced manual data processing by *40%, improving accuracy by **25%*.  
- Cut supply chain waste by *20%* through better demand forecasting and distribution optimization.
