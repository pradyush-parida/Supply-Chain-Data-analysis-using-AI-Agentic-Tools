# Supply Chain Data Analysis & Automation using AI Agentic Workflow Tools

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how *AI Agentic Workflow Automation Tools* like *Quadratic* and *N8N* can be applied to *supply chain management* in the food industry.  
The aim was to *analyze, automate, and optimize* supply chain processes to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform *Supply Chain Data Analysis* to identify inefficiencies.  
- Automate *data workflows* to reduce manual work and errors.  
- Generate actionable insights to enhance *inventory management* and *distribution planning*.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- *Quadratic* – AI-powered spreadsheet for advanced analytics.  
- *N8N* – Automation platform for building workflows.  
- *Excel / CSV Data* – For raw data storage and import.  
- *Python (optional)* – For additional data cleaning & analysis.  

---

## 📊 Key Achievements
- Improved analysis speed by *35%* using *AI Agentic Workflow Automation Tools*.  
- Reduced manual data processing by *40%, improving accuracy by **25%*.  
- Cut supply chain waste by *20%* through better demand forecasting and distribution optimization.

---

## 🚀 Workflow
1. *Data Collection* – Gather raw supply chain data (inventory, demand, shipment logs).  
2. *Data Cleaning* – Process and normalize data in Quadratic.  
3. *Automation Setup* – Create workflows in N8N for repetitive tasks.  
4. *Analysis & Insights* – Use AI to identify bottlenecks and optimize planning.  
5. *Reporting* – Export dashboards and reports for decision-makers.
